For this hackathon, we competed under the data analytics category, which was partnered with Southern Company's Telecom Services branch. We were presented with the following prompt to work on for 24 hours:
How can we use our work management data to understand and improve our productivity?

Over that 24-hour time period, our team found the following two issues the most important for us to address:
1. The underscheduling of departments and overalloting of time for tasks.
2. The company only having one coordinator overseeing and closing all of these tasks.

Along with the issues we found, we compiled a list of data that would have been useful for our problem-solving process that Southern Company did not provide.

After working on the solution for 24 hours, we presented our solutions to Southern Company's representatives. Our documentation, presentation slides, Python programs, and PowerBI file are in this repository, along with the prompt and provided data sheet.
